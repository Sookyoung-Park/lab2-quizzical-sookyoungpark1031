I have created a popular Buzzfeed-style quiz in Korea, which consists of 6 questions with two options each. To ensure accuracy, I referred to the text and images of existing results while iterating on the questions. Based on the combination of the answers to each question, the quiz generates different and interesting results. Give it a try!
